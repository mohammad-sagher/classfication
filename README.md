n this project, we developed an intelligent model that uses artificial intelligence techniques to predict whether a student is experiencing symptoms of depression, based on a set of factors such as age, gender, academic stress, sleep, dietary habits, and more.
The goal of the project is to raise awareness and help students receive psychological support at the right time.
